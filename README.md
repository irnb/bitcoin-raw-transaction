# Bitcoin Raw Transaction Demo

This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to work with Bitcoin transactions using pure Python, without relying on external Bitcoin libraries.

## Features

1. Key Generation
   - Create private keys
   - Derive public keys using elliptic curve cryptography

2. Bitcoin Address Creation
   - Generate legacy Bitcoin addresses
   - Implement proper address encoding with checksums

3. Raw Transaction Creation
   - Build transaction structures from scratch
   - Sign transactions
   - Serialize transactions for broadcasting

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook
3. Follow along with the step-by-step explanations

## Educational Purpose

This notebook is designed to help understand the underlying mechanics of:
- Bitcoin key pairs
- Address generation
- Transaction structure
- Digital signatures in Bitcoin

## Note

This is for educational purposes only. For real Bitcoin transactions, please use well-tested libraries and follow security best practices.
